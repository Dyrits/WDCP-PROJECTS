### Description of the project by [CODE]CADEMY PRO
In this project, we’ll build a program that helps designers think of new color schemes.

Our program will set the screen’s background to a random color. Clicking a button will refresh to a new, random color. [Random generators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_Strategies) are a well-known tool for breaking a creative rut.

Let’s get started!
