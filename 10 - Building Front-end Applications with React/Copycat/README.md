### Description (by [code]cademy / PRO)
In this project, we’ll build a program that lets users type into a textbox and allows them to visualize the immediate effect that these changes have on the web page.

Our program will display a textbox with a picture of a cat beneath it. When users type into the textbox, a copy of the text will appear below the cat image, suggesting that the cat is being a copycat. Clicking on the image of the cat will toggle whether or not it is able to copy the user.

Let’s get started!

### Technologies
- JavaScript
- React

### Details | Comments
Albeit this project has been made following specific instructions, different scripts (CDN) have been used instead of the bundle provided by [code]cademy / PRO.  
The `export` and `import` syntax used with React is not being used in this project, the scripts being all loaded directly in the `index.html` file.  
Hooks have been used.
