### Description of the project by [code]cademy
In this project, you will follow step-by-step instructions to improve a vibrant, color-rich web page for a home paint business. It displays information about using color in a home and color swatches with varying lightness, saturation, and hue.

The page is almost ready to be published. You’ll be making the following color-related changes:  
- Exchange some named colors with hexadecimal color values.  
- Add some semi-transparent overlays to the banner and footer using RGBA.  
- Fill in the first color column of the swatch samples using HSL colors.  

The website’s existing **index.html** and **style.css** document files are displayed in the text editor.
