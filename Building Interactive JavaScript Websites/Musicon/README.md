## [CODE]CADEMY PRO | WEB DEVELOPMENT CAREER PATH > Building Interactive JavaScript Websites > Musicon
### Description of the project by [code]cademy
n this project, you will be updating the website of an online musical instruments store, Musicon. You will incorporate your knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Handlebars to make a stylish multi-page interactive website!

Musicon will have three separate web pages: a home page, a store page, and a contacts page. The home and store pages already have most of the HTML and CSS set up. Your job is to make the following changes:
- Create a navigation bar using unordered lists, anchor tags, and class attributes.
- Style the website using your knowledge of display, positioning, color, and font declarations.
- Build out semantic templates using a client-side templating engine: [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/).
- Display relevant information using JavaScript objects, arrays, and control flow alongside built-in Handlebars iteration and control flow helpers.
