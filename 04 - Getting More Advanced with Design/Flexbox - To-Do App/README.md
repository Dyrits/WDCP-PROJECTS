## [CODE]CADEMY PRO | WEB DEVELOPMENT CAREER PATH > Getting More Advanced with Design > Flexbox - To-Do App
### Description of the project by [code]cademy
In this project, you will follow step-by-step instructions to fix a to-do web app. All of the HTML and most of the CSS is intact, however, a few Flexbox values are missing.

In order to complete this project, you must know how to set an element’s Flexbox properties.

We recommend that you review our Flexbox Lesson before beginning.

The website’s existing **index.html** and **style.css** files are displayed in the text editor to the right. Good luck!
