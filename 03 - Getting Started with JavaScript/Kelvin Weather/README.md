### Description of the project by [code]cademy
Deep in his mountain-side meteorology lab, the mad scientist Kelvin has mastered weather prediction.

Recently, Kelvin began publishing his weather forecasts on his website. However there’s a problem: All of his forecasts describe the temperature in [Kelvin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin).

With our knowledge of JavaScript, let’s convert Kelvin to Celsius, then to Fahrenheit.

For example, 283 K converts to 10 °C which converts to 50 °F.
