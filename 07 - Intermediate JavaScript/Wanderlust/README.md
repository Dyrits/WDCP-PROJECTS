### Description of the project by [CODE]CADEMY PRO
Using `fetch`, `async`, and `await`, you’ll request information from the [Foursquare API](https://developer.foursquare.com/) and [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/current) to create a travel website.  

Before you begin, you’ll need to register for developer accounts for both of the APIs above. They’re both free.  

For Foursquare, once you make an account, [create a new app](https://foursquare.com/developers/register) and fill out the form (you can put any link in the “App or Company URL” field). The Foursquare API will then give you a client ID and a client secret. You’ll need to save both of those in **main.js**.  

For OpenWeather, follow the instructions for the [I. Registration process: How to start](https://openweathermap.org/guide/#how). When prompted, use your first name, and `other` for the OpenWeather questions for their data collection. OpenWeather will give you an API Key, which you’ll also need to save in main.js.
