### Description of the project by [CODE]CADEMY PRO
Congratulations, you’ve passed the grueling rigmarole of librarian school and have become head librarian at your local Books-‘N-Stuff.

Just as you sit down, eager to utilize all those skills you learned in “Lib 203 - Shushing: How to Maintain Order While Spitting”, you realize you’re still using index cards to handle everything.

But no matter, you know some JavaScript, so let’s get to work modernizing your new digs.

Books-‘N-Stuff carries three different types of media: books, CDs, and movies. In this project you will create a parent class named `Media` with three subclasses: `Book`, `Movie`, and `CD`. These three subclasses have the following properties and methods:

#### Book  
- **Properties**: `author` (string), `title` (string), `pages` (number), `isCheckedOut` (boolean, initially false), and `ratings` (array, initially empty).  
- **Getters**: all properties have a getter  
- **Methods**: `.getAverageRating()`, `.toggleCheckOutStatus()`, and `.addRating()  `

#### BMovie  
- **Properties**: `director` (string), `title` (string), `runTime` (number), `isCheckedOut` (boolean, initially false), and `ratings` (array, initially empty)  
- **Getters**: all properties have a getter  
- **Methods**: `.getAverageRating()`, `.toggleCheckOutStatus()`, and `.addRating()  `

#### BCD  
- **Properties**: `artist` (string), `title` (string), `isCheckedOut` (boolean, initially false), and `ratings` (array, initially empty), `songs` (array of strings)  
- **Getters**: all properties have a getter  
- **Methods**: `.getAverageRating()`, `.toggleCheckOutStatus()`, and `.addRating()`  

If you’re looking for a challenge, try to create the four classes without using the steps below.
