#### Create Project & Components

Welcome to the first installment of the Ravenous project! Over the next couple of weeks, you’ll build a website called “Ravenous”, a Yelp-like clone.

In total, there will be four parts to this project:
- Creating Static Components
- Passing Information to Components
- Setting the State of Ravenous Components
- Interacting with the Yelp API

Today, you will start by building the first part of Ravenous: Creating Static Components.

Here’s a quick overview of how Ravenous should function:
- As a user, I should be able to search for restaurants
- As a user, I should be able to view a list of restaurants returned by the Yelp API
- As a user, I should be able to sort through restaurants using a filter

The four projects will test your knowledge of JavaScript and React, all with the goal of building a Yelp-like clone. If you want to get a feel for what Ravenous can be, visit the Yelp website and search for restuarants in your area.

Finally, a few notes before getting started:
- In each project, you’ll be presented with the intended, final outcome (of that project) in the Codecademy browser component.
- You should expect to spend more than 1 day on this specific project. It’s the base of the entire app, and it will likely take a few days to complete this project. It’s OK if it is not all finished in one day.
- If you don’t understand how to implement a certain part of the project, we’ll provide guidance as needed. However, you should expect to search Codecademy for the exercises that will provide you with the relevant information.
- You should expect to complete all four Ravenous projects on your personal computer using your preferred tools (terminal, text editors, etc.).

Let’s get started!

<summary>Passing Information</summary>

#### Passing Information

Welcome to the second part of the Ravenous project! Take a minute to review what you accomplished in the first part of this project. You:
- Used `create-react-app` to start your project
- Built all of the components you’ll need for the remainder of the project
- Simulated what Ravenous should look like after returning search results

In this project, you’ll complete the second part of Ravenous: **Passing Information to Components**.

So far, you’ve hard coded business information and rendered it manually. Now we’ll focus on how information (like business information) can pass from component to component with less hard coding. This is crucial as we build towards the goal of constructing a Yelp-like clone.

A few notes before getting started:
- You should expect to spend more than 1 day on this specific project. It’s OK if it is not all finished in one day.
- If you don’t understand how to implement a certain part of the project, we’ll provide guidance as needed. However, you should expect to search Codecademy for the exercises that will provide you with the relevant information.

#### Setting the Search Bar's State

Welcome to the third part of the Ravenous project! Take a minute to review what you accomplished in the second part of this project. You:
- Moved business information to the container component (`App`)
- Passed information from parent components (`App`) to child components (`BusinessList`, `Business`)

In this project, you’ll complete the third part of Ravenous: **Setting the State of Ravenous Components**.

Certain components will need to handle changes in their state. For example, the sorting options in the search bar will change (and we’ll need to know their state when communicating with the Yelp API). The same goes for the two input elements. These are the kinds of changes you’ll handle in this project.

A few notes before getting started:
- You should expect to spend some time on this project. Don’t worry if you don’t complete it in one sitting.
 - If you don’t understand how to implement a certain part of the project, we’ll try to provide guidance as needed via hints. However, you may need to look back at previous lessons that will provide you with the relevant information.

Let’s get started!

# React

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
