Bash Scripting

### Description of the project by [CODE]CADEMY PRO
One common use of bash scripts is for releasing a “build” of your source code. Sometimes your private source code may contain developer resources or private information that you don’t want to release in the published version.

In this project, you’ll create a release script to copy certain files from a **source** directory into a **build** directory.
